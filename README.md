## Building


The following tools are required:
- **TypeScript compiler**
- **Git LFS** (to get access to the asset files)
- **Closure compiler** (optional)

To build the game, clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/jani-nykanen/time-to-panic
```
and run 
```
tsc
```
(or `make js` if you have `make` installed). It will compile the TypeScript source to Javascript, and you can run the game by starting a server in the root (for example run `make server` and open `localhost:8000` in your browser).

If you want to compile a redistributable and compressed zip package, run 
```
make CLOSURE_PATH=<path to closure jar file> dist 
```
(there is a bug that requires you to run `tsc` first, otherwise the thing will faill).

If you want to make a lot of changes to the source, it is recommended to compile the source in watch mode (`tsc -w` or `make watch`).
